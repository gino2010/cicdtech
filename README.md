# CI/CD Tech
主题为持续集成和持续部署相关技术，也可能包含一些其它的部署相关的技术内容。

The topics in this project are related technologies of continuous integration and continuous deployment, and maybe also include some other deployment-related technical content.

由于平时使用微服务相关开发架构，所以也在使用Docker等容器。有很多内容需要整理，想使用此工程整理相关技术

Since I usually use the micro-service related development architecture, I also use containers such as Docker. There is a lot of content to be sorted out, I want to use this project to organize related technologies.

这里将会包含：
- Docker 相关脚本文件
- Linux 环境脚本文件

Maybe include:

- Script for Docker
- Script for Linux

主要为非编程类的相关技术，相关内容都将基于互联网资源总结。

Mainly for non-programming related technologies, relevant content will be summarized based on Internet resources.

### [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

Agile is NOT a:

- Methodology
- Specific Way of Developing Software
- Framework or Process

Agile is a set of Values and Principles. Be Agile, Don't do.
