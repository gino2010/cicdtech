# Gitlab

公司在用gitlab服务，也是通过docker搭建，这里列出docker-compose基本文件。

Our company is using the gitlab service, which is also built by docker. List docker-compose file here.

计划尝试其中一些细节功能，例如和CI相关的功能等，如有价值，便于今后推广使用。

Plan to try some features, such as CI related, etc., if valuable, I will promote it in my team.

### Edition

这里列出的为Gitlab EE版本，为什么选用此版本，官方给出了[建议说明](https://about.gitlab.com/installation/ce-or-ee/)

To be able to use GitLab Enterprise Edition features, you need a subscription which will give you a license. If you're using Enterprise Edition without a license, you are only using functions that are MIT licensed.

This means that if you have installed GitLab Enterprise Edition without a license, you will not notice a difference with a typical Community Edition instance

So, let's try.

### Features

稍后添加
